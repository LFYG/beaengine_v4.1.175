#BeaEngine v4.1.175
This repository was created because the original web site (http://beaengine.org/) is down for a long time.
The BeaEngine v5.0 (https://github.com/BeaEngine/beaengine) is still under developing.
However, there is the request to recompile stable version of BeaEngine on new compilers.
